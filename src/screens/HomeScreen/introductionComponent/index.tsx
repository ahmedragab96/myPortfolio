        I'm a passionate software engineer, I love learning new skills every day, I don't like anything to stop me, I always say "No one is perfect if I lack a skill, I'll learn it in no time", I hope to find an interesting environment That will help me learn new things -not just in software- and level up my skills.

        <p
          style={{
            marginTop: 5,
            marginBottom: 5,
          }}
        >I'm a very open person to different cultures, I like watching movies from all over the world to try to understand different cultures, I hope to travel the world one day and learn new traditions and spread my own culture.</p>

        I worked with many different programming languages: <b>C++, Python, Javascript </b>with different frameworks: <b>Node.js, ReactJs, React Native and Angular</b>, each language has it's role in helping me understand programming more and more and now I'm more focused on working with Javascript and it's frameworks.
